# Commitment Pattern
## Context
Entities must commit to a certain value without knowing to which values other entities are committed. Entities can only attain the values of other entities once they are all disclosed simultaneously at a certain point in time. These requirements often apply to voting schemes, lotteries, or when using zero-knowledge proofs.

## Problem
Changes in values after commitment must be at least recognizable or prevented. At the same time, the data to which entities committed themselves must not be visible to other entities, which conflicts with the fact that data stored on distributed ledgers are usually visible to all entities with access to the DLT system. The aim of the Commitment Pattern is to ensure that the values, which have been committed, are not visible to other entities and are kept secret until the individual accounts reveal their values while assuring that these values are binding for the corresponding entities.

## Forces
The forces involved in the Commitment Pattern are transaction-ordering dependence, semantic soundness, and resource efficiency. The application of the Commitment Pattern allows the treatment of all commitments of values the same, independent of the order in which the transactions have been submitted. Semantic soundness is improved as the intended execution of the smart contract (to not reveal committed values but still ensure they are binding) can be realized using the Commitment Pattern. This comes at the cost of resource efficiency as additional smart contract code needs to be implemented to realize the Commitment Pattern.

## Solution
Implement a smart contract that includes a mechanism for the commit phase and a mechanism for the reveal phase. During the commit phase, users send values they want to commit to `CommitmentContract` in disguised form (e.g., hashes of these values) so that no other user knows the original values. `CommitmentContract` stores all disguised values in a tamper-resistant way. To disguise the original values, the range of possible original values and their disguised representation must be considered. Otherwise, the original values may be easy to guess. For example, the corresponding pre-image of a hash value may be easy to guess by other users in scenarios with only few original values (e.g., a value v ∊ {1, 2, 3}) because hash functions are deterministic. To avoid easy guessing of the original values, a random salt must be added to each value before disguising the value. During the subsequent reveal phase, all users send their original values and the used random salt to `CommitmentContract`. `CommitmentContract` compares the received values with the corresponding disguised values that the respective user has sent in the commit phase. One approach to check if the plain values correspond to the disguised values is to apply the identical procedure (e.g., keccak to hash the concatenation of the plain value and the salt) and compare the outcome of this procedure with the commitment.

## Example

```Solidity
pragma solidity 0.7.0;

contract CommitmentPattern {
    struct UserCommit { 
        bytes32 secretCommit; 
        bytes32 secretSalt; 
        string plainValue; 
        string plainSalt;
    }

    mapping(address => UserCommit) public userCommits;

    //...
    
    function commit(bytes32 _secretCommit, bytes32 _secretSalt) public {
        require(userCommits[msg.sender].secretCommit == "", "Your commitment cannot be changed anymore.");

        UserCommit memory uC = userCommits[msg.sender];
        uC.secretCommit = _secretCommit;
        uC.secretSalt = _secretSalt;

        userCommits[msg.sender] = uC;
    }

    function reveal(string memory _plainSalt, string memory _plainValue) public { 
        require(userCommits[msg.sender].secretCommit != "", "You did not commit to a value"); 
        require(userCommits[msg.sender].secretSalt == keccak256(abi.encode(_plainSalt)), "Your salt does not match the original one."); 
        require(userCommits[msg.sender].secretCommit == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_plainSalt, _plainValue)), "Invalid values.");

        userCommits[msg.sender].plainSalt = _plainSalt;
        userCommits[msg.sender].plainValue = _plainValue;
    }
}
```

Note: We did not implement events for the sake of simplicity of the example. For better integration into software applications, events should be implemented at the end of the `commit(…)` and/or `reveal(…)` function.

## Resulting Context
The smart contract stores the disguised values in a tamper-resistant way and all commits are binding. The disguised values can be revealed by users afterwards. Developers should consider the case that not all users will reveal their secret values.

## Rationale
The hash value of the nonce and the original value to which the users have committed themselves are stored on the distributed ledger in a tamper-resistant manner and cannot be changed retroactively. Thus, once committed data are binding. To protect data from potential entities who aim to uncover the secret value by guessing, a salt is also stored with the secret value. This way, committed values are kept secret until they are revealed by their issuers.
